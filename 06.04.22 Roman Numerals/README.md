# Decimal To Roman Numerals Kata

The task is to create a program that accepts a **decimal integer** as the input and returns a string containing the representation of that number as **Roman numerals**, and conversely accepts a string containing a number in Roman numerals and returns it as a decimal integer. 

To make it easier, we will specify that the integer will be **unsigned** and that the largest value possible is **3999**. You should account for these limits in your code. 

### Test cases ###

As a test case, consider the number **1987**, which converts to the Roman numerals **MCMLXXXVII**, and **2019**, which converts to **MMXIX**.

### Notes ###

In case you're not familiar with the Roman numbering system, you can find a Wikipedia article explaining it here:

We will be using the standard form only, and whole numbers only. The standard notation cannot contain a number larger than 3999.
