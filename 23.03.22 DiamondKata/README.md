# Diamond Kata

### Problem

Given a character from the alphabet, print a diamond of its output with that character being the midpoint of the diamond.

Examples

    > diamond.exe A
      A

    > diamond.exe B
       A
      B B
       A

    > diamond.exe C
        A
       B B
      C   C
       B B
        A

It may be helpful to visualise the whitespace in your rendering like this:

    > diamond.exe C
    _ _ A _ _
    _ B _ B _
    C _ _ _ C
    _ B _ B _
    _ _ A _ _

Characters only need to be upper-case. Bonus points for the most efficient algorithm!


### The Rules

You must work as a pair with a single codebase between you. We recommend you use ping-pong TDD, but you can work whichever way you like provided you do it as a pair.

You can use any language you like and any platform you like as long as the output is displayed in the format above.

You have **40** minutes to work on the problem. At the end of this time you must stop. Your group coordinator may ask you to demonstrate your solution / working to the group.
